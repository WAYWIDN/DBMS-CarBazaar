## 🚗 Car Bazaar – Relational Database System

Car Bazaar is a comprehensive online platform that streamlines the process of buying, selling, and servicing cars and their accessories. It is backed by a robust relational database system built using **PostgreSQL** and designed in **pgAdmin**.

Users can search, filter, and compare vehicles based on specific features — even down to number plates for second-hand cars. The platform also includes a dedicated section for accessories, complete with user reviews.

For sellers — whether individuals, private dealers, or official outlets — Car Bazaar provides sales analytics to help optimize performance. Buyers can add items to their wishlist, rate products and sellers, and enjoy a reliable end-to-end experience from selection to after-sales service.
